GitHub Pages Project:

This project will be used to create a data analysis blog. The blog will be used as a portfolio to display data analysis projects 
that I'm currently working on, and to discuss previous school and work projects. All code, plots, data files and analysis that I discuss 
in my blog will be stored here.
